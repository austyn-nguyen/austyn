# My Personal _Starry_ Portfolio

This website concept was inspired by Pedro Henrique Ferraz Machado.  
It was built using HTML, CSS, and React (JavaScript, not TypeScript).

The purpose of this portfolio is to offer a deeper, more personal look into my lifeâ€”not just for LinkedIn recruiters, but for anyone interested in learning more about me.  
Feel free to reach out through the contact form on the page with any suggestions, feedback, or stylistic advice! I hope you enjoy exploring the website.
